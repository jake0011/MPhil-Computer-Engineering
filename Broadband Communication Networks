## Assignment One: 
Clearly distinguish between the following terms;
Capacity, Bandwidth, Throughput and Speeds. 

Some are non technical terms and so should be considered. 

Read on Internet over Power line 

Read on SDH, Sonnet Standards

## Solution:
### **Distinguishing Between Capacity, Bandwidth, Throughput, and Speed**

These terms are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings in the context of networking and communication systems. Here's a clear distinction:

---

#### **1. Capacity**
- **Definition**: Capacity refers to the **maximum amount of data** that a communication channel or network can handle at any given time.
- **Technical**: It is a theoretical limit, often determined by the physical properties of the medium (e.g., fiber, copper) and the technology used (e.g., modulation schemes, error correction).
- **Measurement**: Expressed in **bits per second (bps)**, such as Mbps or Gbps.
- **Example**: A fiber-optic link might have a capacity of 10 Gbps, meaning it can theoretically transmit up to 10 billion bits per second.

---

#### **2. Bandwidth**
- **Definition**: Bandwidth refers to the **range of frequencies** available for transmitting data over a communication channel.
- **Technical**: It is a measure of the **width of the frequency spectrum** allocated for communication. Higher bandwidth allows more data to be transmitted simultaneously.
- **Measurement**: Expressed in **Hertz (Hz)**, such as MHz or GHz.
- **Example**: A Wi-Fi channel might have a bandwidth of 20 MHz, meaning it uses a 20 MHz range of the frequency spectrum.

---

#### **3. Throughput**
- **Definition**: Throughput is the **actual amount of data** successfully transmitted over a network in a given time period.
- **Technical**: It is a practical measure of network performance, accounting for real-world factors like interference, congestion, and protocol overhead.
- **Measurement**: Expressed in **bits per second (bps)**, such as Mbps or Gbps.
- **Example**: Even if a network has a capacity of 1 Gbps, the throughput might only be 800 Mbps due to network congestion or packet loss.

---

#### **4. Speed**
- **Definition**: Speed is a **non-technical term** often used to describe how fast data is transmitted or received over a network.
- **Non-Technical**: It is commonly used by end-users to refer to the perceived performance of their internet connection.
- **Measurement**: Often expressed in **bits per second (bps)**, but can also be used informally (e.g., "fast" or "slow").
- **Example**: A user might say, "My internet speed is 100 Mbps," referring to the throughput they experience.

### **Internet Over Power Line (IPL)**
- **Definition**: Internet over Power Line (IPL), also known as **Power Line Communication (PLC)**, is a technology that enables data transmission over existing electrical power lines.
- **How It Works**:
  - Data signals are modulated onto the electrical wiring in a home or building.
  - Special adapters are used to connect devices to the power lines for internet access.
- **Advantages**:
  - Utilizes existing infrastructure (no need for new cables).
  - Easy to deploy in areas where running Ethernet cables is difficult.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited bandwidth compared to fiber or coaxial cables.
  - Susceptible to interference from electrical appliances.
  - Distance limitations due to signal attenuation.
- **Applications**:
  - Home networking (e.g., connecting smart devices).
  - Rural broadband access where traditional internet infrastructure is unavailable.

### **SDH and SONET Standards**

#### **1. SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)**
- **Definition**: SDH is a standardized technology for transmitting large volumes of data over fiber-optic networks. It is widely used in Europe and other parts of the world.
- **Key Features**:
  - Synchronous transmission: All network elements are synchronized to a common clock.
  - High reliability and fault tolerance.
  - Supports multiplexing of multiple data streams.
- **Data Rates**:
  - STM-1: 155.52 Mbps
  - STM-4: 622.08 Mbps
  - STM-16: 2.488 Gbps
  - STM-64: 9.953 Gbps

#### **2. SONET (Synchronous Optical Networking)**
- **Definition**: SONET is the North American equivalent of SDH, designed for high-speed data transmission over fiber-optic networks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Similar to SDH but uses different terminology and data rates.
  - Provides a standardized way to transport multiple digital signals over a single fiber.
- **Data Rates**:
  - OC-1: 51.84 Mbps
  - OC-3: 155.52 Mbps
  - OC-12: 622.08 Mbps
